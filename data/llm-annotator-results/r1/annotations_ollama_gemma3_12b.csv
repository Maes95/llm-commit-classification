0b94f2651f,ollama_gemma3_12b,3,"The commit addresses a potential use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the Bluetooth HCI synchronization queue. Specifically, it prevents commands from being queued after `hci_unregister_dev` has been called, which would lead to a UAF because the `hdev` would be freed. The change ensures that no further commands are processed after the device is unregistered, mitigating the risk of accessing freed memory.",4,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,68.234,,,,,,
