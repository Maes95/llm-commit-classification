131a79b474,ollama_hf.co_NousResearch_Hermes-4.3-36B-GGUF_Q4_K_M,3,"The commit addresses issues related to vma lock handling in hugetlb during operations like splitting a VMA (vm_area_dup) and unmapping ranges. Specifically: 1) It ensures that when a VMA is duplicated for sharing (VM_MAYSHARE), the new VMA gets its own dedicated vma_lock structure, preventing issues like double-freeing or incorrect lock ownership from the original VMA's copied pointer. This involves modifying `hugetlb_vm_op_open` to conditionally allocate a new lock and clear any existing one for the duplicated VMA if it's shareable. 2) It changes how unmapping prevents future PMD sharing: instead of clearing the VM_MAYSHARE flag in `__unmap_hugepage_range_final`, it now frees the vma_lock itself (after acquiring necessary locks like i_mmap_rwsem and the hugetlb lock). This makes the VMA ineligible for sharing. 3) It updates the PMD sharing check (`page_table_shareable`) to require a valid `vm_private_data` (the vma_lock pointer), ensuring that only properly locked VMs can participate.",4,3,2,0,,,,,,,,,115.606,,,,,,
