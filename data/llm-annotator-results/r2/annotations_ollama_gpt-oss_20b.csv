131a79b474,ollama_gpt-oss_20b_r2,4,"This patch fixes several bugs in the huge page VMA handling code. It corrects a race in the unmap routine by properly acquiring and releasing the VMA lock, ensures that a VMA lock is allocated for all VM_MAYSHARE mappings (not just those that can share PMDs), and prevents double‑freeing of the lock when a VMA is duplicated during a split. It also changes the final unmap routine to unlock and free the VMA lock before releasing the i_mmap_rwsem, which stops a VMA from being considered shareable after it has been torn down. The code is refactored to clear the old lock pointer when a VMA is duplicated, to use the new lock in the sharing test, and to simplify the lock‑free logic.
