0b94f2651f,ollama_gpt-oss_20b,4,"The commit modifies the HCI command synchronization queue logic to detect when a Bluetooth device has been unregistered (HCI_UNREGISTER flag set).

131a79b474,ollama_gpt-oss_20b,4,"The commit fixes race conditions and double‑free bugs in the hugetlb VMA lock handling during VMA splitting and range unmapping. It ensures that a new VMA lock is allocated for duplicated VMA objects, updates the unmap routine to free the lock instead of clearing VM_MAYSHARE, and modifies the pmd sharing logic to require the presence of a VMA lock. These changes prevent both current failures and future bugs related to lock handling.",4,3,0,0,,,,,,,,,58.011,,,,,,

23cc6d8c37,ollama_gpt-oss_20b,4,"The commit changes the type of the key_idx field in the cfg80211_auth_request structure from unsigned to signed. This allows the field to hold a value of -1, which is used when the key is NULL and the key index is not applicable. The change is made to avoid static analysis warnings (e.g., from smatch) that arise when an unsigned field is assigned a negative value.
