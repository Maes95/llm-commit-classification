131a79b474,ollama_gpt-oss_20b,4,"This patch fixes several bugs in the huge page (hugetlb) subsystem related to VMA lock handling during VMA splitting and range unmapping. It prevents a race in `hugetlb_unmap_file_folio` by correctly acquiring and releasing locks, ensures that all VM_MAYSHARE VMA mappings have a dedicated lock to avoid double‑freeing when `vm_area_dup()` copies the lock pointer, and changes the unmap logic to unlock and free the VMA lock instead of merely clearing the VM_MAYSHARE flag. The patch also updates the pmd sharing logic to require the presence of a VMA lock and refines the lock‑free helper to check shareable flags. Overall, it corrects race conditions, memory‑management bugs, and improves future safety by enforcing lock presence on all shareable VMA mappings.",4,2,1,0,,,,,,,,,64.2,,,,,,
